# cl-protobufs

Protocol Buffer implementation for Common Lisp.

The project main branch is hosted here (at least, what's on
Quicklisp):

https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/qitab/cl-protobufs

So, why am I hosting it here?  There was no readme/explanation of how
to use the setup on that site, and it was also missing a readme.

For any problems, visit the link above.
